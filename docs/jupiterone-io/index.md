# Integration with JupiterOne

## CrowdStrike + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize your CrowdStrike endpoint agents and the devices they protect in the
  JupiterOne graph.
- Map endpoint agents to devices and devices to the employee who is the owner.  
- Monitor changes to CrowdStrike endpoints using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches CrowdStrike agents and devices to update the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires an API client ID and client secret configured in your 
CrowdStrike account with the appropriate permissions. 
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.

## Support
